            <h2 style = "color:rgb(250,250,250)">Explanation</h2>
            <p>This is a collection of javascript projects I submitted for my ap 2d art class. 
                The main goal of my art here was a sustained investigation into memories and the perception of time, mostly focusing on the past and future.
                I tried conveying time and its associated feelings with movement and warping of otherwise traditional objects. 
                In total, I made 8 projects (the remaining 4 will be added here soon), building upon each one and increasing in complexity each time.
            </p>

            <h2 style = "color:rgb(250,250,250)">Piece 1: Uncertainty</h2>
      
      <p>This is a work in progress of a landscape based off a piece I made some time ago. There is a scrolling edition as well with a parallax effect.
        The image is proceduraly generated, so you can get a new picture each time you click on the canvas. 
        Occasionally, a moon, secondary planet, and stars will appear in addition to the three spike types visible.</p>

      <h2 style = "color:rgb(250,250,250)">Piece 2: Juxtaposition</h2>
      <p>In making this, I wanted to improve a few areas from my first project.
        I wanted to increase overall movement, engage in different forms of interactivity, and take real-world images and incorporate them into what I make.</p>

        <h2 style = "color:rgb(250,250,250)">Piece 3: Forgetfulness</h2>
        <p>This piece focuses on the process of forgetting a memory. 
          Press the button at the bottom of the screen to "re-remember" the memory, thereby redrawing it. 
          This project uses a significant amount of memory, so I have it in a link instead of in the main page.</p>
