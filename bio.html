            <h2>Bio:</h2>
            <p>Hi! My name is Andrew Boyacigiller. I am currently attending Brown University where I am studying Computer Science and Music.
                My current plans are to focus on computer vision and backend programming, while also composing and singing on the side.
                I also have an interest in rocketry, particularly regarding orbital mechanics and the material physics behind aerospace engineering.
            </p>

            <h2>Classes</h2>
            <p>I'm currently taking the hardest CS class available to me, CSCI0190, which focuses on functional programming in Racket and Pyret. 
                The class focused heavily on testing and code coverage, as well as general style, which I feel really helped me design more effective solutions to problems.
            </p>

            <p>I'm planning on taking CSCI0300 and CSCI1430, focusing on x86/C and computer vision respectively. 
                After that in my sophomore year, I will be taking a deep learning course as well as a few web development and theory of computation courses.
            </p>
